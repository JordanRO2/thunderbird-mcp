/**
 * interface/compose_tools.js — the 7 compose / template MCP tool handlers.
 *
 * Thin edge: each handler maps the raw tool-call args to a composeService
 * method (the central validateToolArgs/coerceToolArgs in dispatch.js already
 * ran). Handlers are registered into the dispatch registry via
 * ctx.registerToolHandler(name, fn) so callTool routes compose here instead of
 * the legacy switch in api.js.
 *
 * Tool names/args/behavior are preserved exactly — the registerToolHandler
 * arg unpacking is copied verbatim from the legacy switch cases in api.js:
 *   sendMail(to, subject, body, cc, bcc, isHtml, from, attachments, skipReview, idempotencyKey) -> composeMail
 *   saveDraft(to, subject, body, cc, bcc, isHtml, from, attachments)
 *   replyToMessage(messageId, folderPath, body, replyAll, isHtml, to, cc, bcc, from, attachments, skipReview, idempotencyKey)
 *   forwardMessage(messageId, folderPath, to, body, isHtml, cc, bcc, from, attachments, skipReview, idempotencyKey)
 *   dryRunCompose(to, subject, body, cc, bcc, isHtml, from, attachments)
 *   listTemplates()
 *   renderTemplate(name, vars)
 *
 * NOTE: the public MCP tool name for new-message compose is "sendMail"; it maps
 * to the service's composeMail() (the historical internal name). saveDraft /
 * replyToMessage / forwardMessage are async (return Promises) and the registry
 * awaits them via callTool.
 *
 * The COMPOSE_TOOL_DEFS below mirror the metadata for these tools. The LIVE
 * `tools` array in api.js remains the single source of truth (a structural test
 * parses api.js for the `{ name: "…" }` declarations); these defs exist so a
 * reader can see the compose surface in one place and so a future api.js can
 * assemble its array from per-domain contributions without changing the test.
 *
 * Consumes from ctx: composeService, registerToolHandler
 * Registers onto ctx:
 *   composeMail, saveDraft, replyToMessage, forwardMessage,
 *   dryRunCompose, listTemplates, renderTemplate  (back-compat, so the legacy
 *     api.js destructure still finds them if referenced),
 *   COMPOSE_TOOL_DEFS
